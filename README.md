# Digit_Recognizer
Built a neural network (NN) using only NumPy for efficient array manipulation.<br />
The NN consists of: an input layer (784 neurons), one hidden layer (100 neurons), output layer (10 neurons).<br />
Implemented the tanh and softmax functions as activation functions for the hidden and output layers.<br />
Used both forward and backward propagation to train the neural network.<br />
Calculated the squared loss between expected and predicted values.<br />
Calculated gradient descent to optimize the network parameters.<br />
Accuracy reaches 97.5%
